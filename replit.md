## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frontend frameworks)
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3.0 for responsive design
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0 for consistent iconography
- **Communication**: RESTful API calls using fetch/AJAX
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templating engine with Flask

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask with modular Blueprint structure
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- **Blueprints**: Separate blueprints for auth, booking, admin, and doctor functionality
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions for user authentication
- **Password Security**: Werkzeug for password hashing and verification

### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: SQLite (with MySQL compatibility)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with DeclarativeBase
- **Connection Pool**: Configured with recycling and pre-ping for reliability
- **Database URL**: Environment-configurable via DATABASE_URL

## Key Components

### Models (models.py)
- **User**: Handles patients, doctors, and admins with role-based access
- **Clinic**: Manages clinic information and relationships
- **Doctor**: Links users to clinics with professional details
- **TimeSlot**: Manages available appointment slots
- **Appointment**: Tracks bookings with status management

### Route Blueprints
1. **Authentication (auth.py)**: Login, registration, and session management
2. **Booking (booking.py)**: Patient appointment booking flow
3. **Admin (admin.py)**: Administrative functions for managing the system
4. **Doctor (doctor.py)**: Doctor dashboard and appointment management

### Frontend Components
- **Base Template**: Consistent navigation and layout structure
- **Dashboard Views**: Role-specific interfaces for different user types
- **Booking Flow**: Multi-step appointment booking process
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation

## Data Flow

### Patient Booking Flow
1. Patient selects a clinic from available options
2. System displays doctors associated with selected clinic
3. Patient chooses a doctor to see available time slots
4. Patient selects preferred time slot and confirms booking
5. System prevents double-booking through database constraints

### Authentication Flow
1. Users register with role specification (patient/doctor/admin)
2. Login validates credentials and establishes session
3. Role-based access control redirects to appropriate dashboard
4. Session management maintains user state across requests

### Admin Management Flow
1. Admins can create and manage clinics
2. Doctor accounts can be created and assigned to clinics
3. Time slots can be managed for doctors
4. Appointment oversight and management capabilities

## External Dependencies
